<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As Maggie, a retired teacher, I want to upload and organize my shopping receipts in one place
    so that I can easily find them later for returns and track my monthly spending.</p>

<h2>Use Case</h2>
<h2>Precondition:</h2>
<p>Maggie is logged into her Vaultify account on her laptop.</p>

<h2>Post condition:</h2>
<p>Maggie has successfully uploaded her receipts, can view them in the monthly summary, and knows her total spending for the month.</p>
