<h1>Vaultify : Maggie's Persona</h1>

<p>
    For this UI/UX challenge, I chose to create a persona for the <strong>Vaultify Web Application</strong>,
    a project designed to help users easily organize and track their shopping receipts online.
    The featured persona, <strong>Margaret “Maggie” Wilson</strong>, is a 72-year-old widow who enjoys staying
    independent and organized. Maggie shops at Costco once a month and visits her local produce market twice a month.
    She often keeps paper receipts for possible returns, but sometimes struggles to find the right one when she needs it.
    With Vaultify, Maggie can scan, upload, and store her receipts digitally while also viewing a summary of her
    monthly spending. This simple and user-friendly tool helps her stay on top of her budget and reduce paper clutter,
    giving her peace of mind and confidence in managing her expenses.
