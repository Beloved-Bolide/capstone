## Running the  Project For the First Time
1. create a project.env at `/project.env` based off `/example.env`
    * Catastrophic failure if `/project.env` is pushed to github, get immediate instructor help.
    * make sure to update the environment variables in `/project.env` to match your project
1. `cd` into `/backend`
2. Run `npm i`
    * This creates `/backend/package-lock.json` Which is necessary to start docker 
3. create a deployment on your digital ocean droplet
4. preform a mass upload of the files in this repository to your droplet
5. ssh into your droplet and `cd` into the directory where you uploaded the project
6. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the application

## Running the Project After the First Time
1. ssh into your droplet and `cd` into the directory where you uploaded the project
2. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the application

## gaining access to development logs
1. ssh into your droplet and `cd` into the directory where you uploaded the project
2. Run `docker compose logs -f` to access console logs from the application

## Stopping the Project
1. ssh into your droplet and `cd` into the directory where you uploaded the project
2. Run `docker compose down` to stop the application



## Calling API (In Postman or Insomnia)
The routes are formed as follows:
http://`[ipaddress]`:`[port]`/api /`[entity]`/`[how we want to get it]`/`[param?]`
